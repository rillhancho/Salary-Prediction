# Salary-Prediction
I developed a salary prediction tool using linear regression to estimate salaries based on years of experience. The model, trained in Jupyter Notebook, was serialized as a pickle file for seamless integration into a Django app. Users input experience years, and the app instantly predicts salaries, showcasing practical AI skills.
